Following the ethos of all our Clausehound products, this "blueprint" is designed to guide, and creates a trail, both for new businesses to follow, and also supply new employees at an existing business with information and access to key customer documents.

A platform that lets you create, manage and track all legal documents.

#### Know What Legal Documents Your Company Needs.

Don't start from scratch when determining which legal documents you require. Blueprint starts by asking a series of questions that are specific to your company's industry. Receive a list of "placeholders" from an inventory of the hundreds of documents that would form the typical foundation of a mature business in your industry.

These frameworks are neither "prescriptive" nor "restricted", but rather provide both a guide and a note-taking tool for businesses to collect their thoughts around the details of building their legal foundation.

#### Get Assistance from Your Peers and Legal Experts

Paperchaser's collaboration tools provide a framework for the discussion of best practices amongst the thousands of businesses who are our community members. Join a group that is industry-specific to access both experts and peers, who are discussing the finer points of the applications, permits, registrations and various documents you are generating.

#### Document tracking and management

Documents can get lost in crowded file cabinets or digital folders, and keeping track of expiry dates and deadlines can be very tedious. Paperchaser stores all documents within their designated category for easy access. Most importantly, all expiry dates and deadlines are integrated into the platform, reminding users of when their document needs to be renewed.
